## Project Motivation
The prediction of stock price volatility is an important task in the field of finance. Accurate volatility prediction can help investors make informed decisions about their portfolio, including when to buy and sell stocks and how to hedge against potential losses. It can also help financial institutions manage their risk exposure and make more informed investment decisions.

One popular method for predicting stock price volatility is the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model. The GARCH model is a time-series model that captures the time-varying nature of volatility and allows for the incorporation of various external factors that may affect the volatility of a particular stock.

In this project, we propose to use the GARCH model to predict the volatility of Apple stock. We will first gather and pre-process the necessary data (stock price). We will then fit the GARCH model to the data and use it to make short-term forecasts of the stock's volatility. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the model.

Overall, the goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate method for predicting stock price volatility using the GARCH model. This will have important practical applications for investors and financial institutions, and will also contribute to the broader field of financial modeling and prediction.

## File Descriptions
There is 1 python notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. The dataset can be found via Alpha Vantage API. Additionally, the "requirements.txt" is available to depict the needed libraries.
